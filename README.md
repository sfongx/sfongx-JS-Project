# sfongx-JS-Project
A project that involves the use of Javascript together with HTML and CSS.

This consisted of three parts:

P1: A game of Whack-A-Mole


P2: A shoutbox implemented with AJAX


P3: An implementation of OpenStreepMap with Leaflet.js that uses Wikipedia data
to generate placemarks for Wikipedia pages based on its geo data (if it exists).
NOTE: To get this to work on my own computer wtih a php server I needed to
install php curl with the following command (after looking it up on Stack Overflow): 

sudo apt-get install php5-curl
